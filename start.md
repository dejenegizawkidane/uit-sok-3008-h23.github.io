## Course Description 

This is an applied course in the disciplines of economics and marketing. The course is designed to give students sufficient background to formulate, estimate, and interpret theoretically consistent market demand relationships. After completing this course, you should be able to do price analysis using classic demand models, like the Rotterdam and Almost Ideal demand model. Furthermore, focus will be on advanced quantitative models in economics, finance and marketing research. We will mainly use R for the estimations.
